        /* 
        TODO: Style your page here.

        Theme:
        - Define a color theme for the page using CSS variables for easy theme management.
        - Choose a font family and set font sizes to ensure readability.
        Example:
        :root {
            --main-color: #000000;
            --main-font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
            --main-font-size: 16px;
        }

        Layout:
        - Use modern layout techniques like Flexbox to structure your content.
        - Style the following key sections of the page: .main-container, .page-header, .page-main, .page-right-rail, .page-footer.

        Navigation:
        - Create a navbar with consistent styling for items like "Home," "About Physics," and "Examples".

        Cards:
        - Design cards with a modern UI look. Ensure each card has a title, description, and a link.
        - Remember the importance of visual hierarchy in design.

        Interactivity:
        - Add hover effects for better user experience.
        - Introduce subtle animations, like content loading, for a more dynamic feel.

        Accessibility:
        - Ensure your design is accessible. Use semantic HTML, adequate color contrast, and provide alt text for images.

        TODO: Create the layout for the page.

        Header:
        - Design a fixed header with a navbar.
        - Consider adding a catchy phrase or title like `Physics Fun` to make the page more engaging.

        Main Content:
        - Display a dynamic title and paragraph based on the page's context.
        - Use semantic HTML tags for better accessibility and SEO.

        Side Rail:
        - Introduce cards that highlight various physics topics.
        - Ensure each card is visually distinct and contains relevant information.

        Footer:
        - Display personal developer information on the left (name, GitHub details).
        - On the right, show the current year and useful resource links.
        - Remember to use semantic HTML tags like <footer> for better structure.

    /* 
    TODO: Add interactivity to your page using JavaScript.

    Basics:
    - Retrieve and display the current year dynamically.
    - Detect the current page and set the title and paragraph content accordingly.

    Cards:
    - Dynamically set titles, descriptions, and links for the physics cards.

    Advanced:
    - Consider using JavaScript ES6+ features like template literals, arrow functions, and destructuring for cleaner code.
    - Use arrays and loops to make your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
    - Remember to avoid global namespace pollution. Consider using IIFEs or modules.
    - Ensure your scripts are optimized for performance. Avoid unnecessary DOM manipulations.
